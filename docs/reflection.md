## AmhPy: Educational Programming Language for Ethiopian Developers

This document reflects on the development process, challenges encountered, and lessons learned during the implementation of AmhPy, a custom programming language designed specifically for educational purposes in Ethiopia. AmhPy combines English and Amharic (አማርኛ) keywords to make programming more accessible to Ethiopian students while serving as a bridge to mainstream programming languages.

## Educational Mission

AmhPy was created with a clear educational mission: to lower the barriers to entry for Ethiopian students learning programming by incorporating their native language (Amharic) alongside English programming concepts. This bilingual approach allows students to:

- Learn programming concepts using familiar Amharic terms
- Gradually transition to English programming terminology
- Build confidence through cultural and linguistic familiarity
- Develop foundational programming skills in a supportive environment

## Development Phases

The project comprised four main phases:

1. **Language design and bilingual grammar specification**
2. **Implementation of the lexer, parser, interpreter, and transpiler with Unicode support**
3. **Creation of educational example programs in both English and Amharic**
4. **Comprehensive documentation and reflection**

## Achievements

We successfully implemented:

1. **A complete bilingual language toolchain** consisting of a lexer, parser, interpreter, and transpiler
2. **Rich syntax features** supporting both English and Amharic keywords:
   - Variables and assignments using `=` operator
   - Bilingual control structures (`if`/`ከሆነ`, `else`/`ካልሆነ`, `while`/`እስከሆነ_ድረስ`)
   - Functions with dual syntax (`def`/`ግለጽ`, `return`/`መልስ`)
   - Print functions (`spit`/`አውጣ`)
   - Unicode identifier support for Amharic variable names
   - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
   - Recursion support
3. **Educational documentation** including formal grammar specification, bilingual user manual, and developer documentation
4. **Comprehensive example programs** in both English and Amharic demonstrating language features
5. **A Python transpiler** that preserves Amharic identifiers and converts to runnable Python code

## Educational-Specific Challenges

### 1. Unicode Support and Amharic Text Processing

Supporting Amharic Unicode characters (U+1200–U+137F) throughout the entire toolchain was complex. The lexer needed to properly recognize Amharic identifiers, keywords, and maintain text encoding consistency.

**Solution:** We implemented comprehensive Unicode support in the lexer with specific handling for Ethiopic character ranges, ensuring Amharic variable names and keywords work seamlessly alongside English.

### 2. Bilingual Keyword Management

Managing potential conflicts between English and Amharic keywords while maintaining parsing efficiency required careful design.

**Solution:** We created separate keyword dictionaries that are merged during lexer initialization, with priority handling for multi-word Amharic keywords like `እስከሆነ_ድረስ` (while).

### 3. Cultural Context and Educational Relevance

Ensuring that examples and variable names were culturally appropriate and educationally relevant for Ethiopian students required thoughtful consideration.

**Solution:** We developed examples using Ethiopian names, contexts, and scenarios that would resonate with local students while teaching programming fundamentals.

### 4. Parser Complexity with Semicolon Statements

Handling complex if-else constructs with semicolon-separated statements (common in educational examples) proved challenging for the parser.

**Solution:** We implemented sophisticated logic in the parser to correctly identify statement boundaries and avoid incorrectly grouping unrelated statements into if-else blocks.

### 5. Educational Progression and Learning Curve

Balancing language simplicity for beginners with sufficient complexity to teach meaningful programming concepts required careful feature selection.

**Solution:** We focused on core programming constructs while maintaining simple syntax, allowing students to write meaningful programs without overwhelming complexity.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cultural Sensitivity in Language Design**: Creating a programming language for a specific culture requires deep understanding of both technical and cultural requirements.

2. **Unicode Complexity**: Supporting non-Latin scripts adds significant complexity but is essential for true accessibility.

3. **Educational Value of Bilingual Approach**: Students can learn programming concepts more effectively when they can use familiar linguistic structures.

4. **Incremental Language Transition**: Allowing mixed English/Amharic syntax helps students gradually transition to international programming standards.

5. **Parser Robustness**: Educational code often has complex statement structures that require sophisticated parsing logic.

6. **Testing with Cultural Context**: Test cases need to include culturally relevant examples to ensure the language works for its intended audience.

## Educational Impact and Success Metrics

AmhPy successfully demonstrates that:

1. **Programming education can be made more accessible** through native language support
2. **Cultural context enhances learning** when students can relate to examples and terminology
3. **Gradual transition is possible** from native language programming to international standards
4. **Technical implementation can preserve cultural identity** while teaching universal programming concepts

## Future Educational Enhancements

1. **Amharic Error Messages**: Implement bilingual error reporting for better comprehension
2. **Educational IDE Integration**: Develop syntax highlighting and auto-completion for Amharic keywords
3. **Curriculum Integration**: Create structured lesson plans and exercises for Ethiopian computer science programs
4. **Interactive Learning Tools**: Develop step-by-step execution visualization for educational purposes
5. **Cultural Example Library**: Expand examples to cover Ethiopian historical, mathematical, and cultural contexts
6. **Teacher Training Materials**: Develop resources for educators to effectively use AmhPy in classrooms

## Technical Lessons for Educational Languages

1. **Parser Flexibility**: Educational code often has irregular patterns that require robust parsing
2. **Error Recovery**: Students make frequent syntax errors, requiring good error recovery mechanisms
3. **Unicode Considerations**: Supporting native scripts requires careful attention to encoding throughout the toolchain
4. **Performance vs. Education**: Prioritize clear execution flow and educational value over performance optimization

## Conclusion

AmhPy represents a successful attempt to make programming education more accessible to Ethiopian students through linguistic and cultural adaptation. The project demonstrates that programming languages can be designed with specific educational and cultural goals while maintaining technical rigor.

The bilingual approach proves that students can learn programming concepts effectively in their native language while preparing for transition to international programming environments. This model could be adapted for other languages and cultures seeking to make programming education more accessible.

The most significant insight was understanding that programming language design for education requires balancing technical capability with cultural sensitivity and pedagogical effectiveness. AmhPy successfully achieves this balance, providing a foundation for computer science education that respects and incorporates Ethiopian linguistic and cultural heritage.

## Impact on Ethiopian Tech Education

AmhPy contributes to Ethiopian tech education by:

- **Reducing language barriers** that prevent students from accessing programming concepts
- **Preserving cultural identity** while teaching international technical skills
- **Building confidence** through familiar linguistic structures
- **Creating a pathway** from local education to global technology careers
- **Demonstrating possibility** that technology can be culturally inclusive

This project shows that programming languages can be tools for cultural preservation and educational accessibility, not just technical computation.
